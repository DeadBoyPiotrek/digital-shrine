In recent years, the popularity of **dark themes** on websites and applications has exploded.

Dark theme is a color scheme that uses light-colored text and other UI elements on a dark background. This color scheme is often easier on the eyes, especially in low-light environments, and it can also save battery life on devices with OLED or AMOLED displays.

There are several reasons why every website should have a dark mode option. First and foremost, dark theme is easier on the eyes, which can reduce eye strain and fatigue. This is especially important for people who spend a lot of time looking at screens, such as office workers or students. By providing a dark mode option, websites can make the user experience more comfortable and enjoyable.

Another reason why every website should have a dark mode is that it can save battery life on devices with OLED or AMOLED displays. These types of displays use individual pixels that can be turned off completely to produce true black. In a light mode, these pixels are constantly lit, which can drain the battery faster. In a dark mode, however, many of these pixels can be turned off, which can extend the battery life of the device.

In addition to the benefits for users, having a dark mode option can also improve the accessibility of a website. Some people, such as those with visual impairments, may have difficulty reading text on a light background. By providing a dark mode option, websites can make their content more accessible to a wider range of users.

Overall, the advantages of having a dark theme option on a website are numerous. From reducing eye strain and fatigue to improving accessibility and saving battery life, dark mode can provide a better experience for users and make a website more user-friendly. As a result, every website should consider offering a dark mode option to their users.
